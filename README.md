### Running the Application
We have successfully developed the Mini Todo Management web application. Now it's time to deploy our application in a servlet container(embedded tomcat). Two ways we can start the standalone Spring boot application.
1) From the root directory of the application and type the following command to run it -
```sh
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```
2) From your IDE, run the TodoManagementSpringBootApplication.main() method as a standalone Java class that will start the embedded Tomcat server on port 8080 and point the browser to http://localhost:8080/
